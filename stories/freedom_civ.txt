Freedom & Civilization or Freedom and Civilization is a 1944 book by the Polish scholar Bronisław Malinowski.[1][2][3][4][5][6] It was based on Malinowski's lectures from his time at Yale University, and published posthumously by Roy Publishers, two years after Malinowski's death.[1]

I... believe that without freedom and democracy, civilization cannot survive."[7]

Bronisław Malinowski, 1944
Development
The book has been written during Malinowski's sabbatical in the United States, which became interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.[3] He became an outspoken critic of Nazi Germany, arguing that it posed to a threat to civilization, and he repeatedly urged American citizens to abandon their neutrality; as a result, his books became banned in Germany.[3][8]

Content
Freedom & Civilization consists of his lectures, given to American listeners at Yale University, on the topics of freedom, collected and edited by his wife Valetta Swann.[2][6]

Antonia Wenkart summarized the book in 1945 for the American Journal of Psychoanalysis. She noted that Malinowski discusses freedom as a natural and desirable state of all living beings. As society becomes more complex, freedom becomes dependent upon the use or abuse of authority by the leaders of a given society.[5]

Edmund Leach, reviewing this work for Nature, called it Malinowski's "political testament".[1] It has been described as an "anti-totalitarian" as Malinowski condemned such regimes as existing for the purpose of waging war, and while doing so, trampling on the concept of freedom.[2][3][9]

Vinay Kumar Srivastava writing for Sociological Bulletin in 1985 noted that the book is a "full length commentary on freedom".[3] Srivastava later noted that the book might have been better called Freedom and Culture to reflect its contents, also because Malinowski himself admits that advanced civilization is not necessary for freedom to exist.[2] He also summarized Malinowski's argument as follows: freedom is an essential element of culture and civilization. It emerges from culture and is essential for its continuation and development, and when freedom is threatened by an ideology (in particular, totalitarian), cultural progress falters. To prevent wars and totalitarian ideology, Malinowski suggested the formation of world government, in the form of a reinvented League of Nations.[2][6]
